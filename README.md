# Machine Learning Study Club

In 2017, I get a chance to conduct a workshop about basic machine learning on my university. This is the material that I have used for workshop :

* [Course 1 - Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/sofianfadli95/Study-Club-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing)

* [Course 2 - Regression](https://github.com/sofianfadli95/Study-Club-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%202%20-%20Regression)

* [Course 3 - Classification](https://github.com/sofianfadli95/Study-Club-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%203%20-%20Classification)

* [Course 4 - Clustering](https://github.com/sofianfadli95/Study-Club-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%204%20-%20Clustering)

* [Course 5 - Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/sofianfadli95/Study-Club-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%205%20-%20Reinforcement%20Learning)
